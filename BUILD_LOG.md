Tests: 26 passed, 49 errors (75 collected) — NOT the expected 75/75 green. See
"Deviations" below; not fixed in this prompt, flagged for a decision.

Decisions made (left open by the prompt/instructions):
- `lib_snapshot/` at the project root, not nested under `lib_referral/`, per
  explicit correction — verified `ROOT`/`MIGRATIONS_DIR`/`TEMPLATES_DIR`/
  `PROMPTS_DIR` all resolve under `Job-ScannerOutreach/` with zero code edits.
- `scanner/config.yaml` placed inside `scanner/` (matches `wd_config.py`'s existing
  `SCANNER_CONFIG_PATH` default, not job-scanner's own root-level layout).
- `classifier_rules.yaml` placed at the project root, not inside `scanner/` —
  `classifier.py`'s `load_rules()` opens a bare relative filename resolved
  against CWD, not against `__file__`. This placement is a judgment call, not
  yet verified against a real end-to-end pipeline run (see DRIFT.md).
- requirements.txt version pins mirror referral-system's own pins for shared
  packages (same library versions the vendored code was written against), not
  just "whatever resolves." openpyxl==3.1.5 pinned though unused by the current
  closure (per explicit instruction, for a future prompt).

Deviations from the prompt, and why:
- **Two gaps found and fixed during VERIFY, not before**: `scanner/pipeline.py`
  itself (the entry point the import graph was traced from) was omitted from
  the initial copy pass — only its 18-file closure was copied, not the entry
  file. `scanner/config.yaml` and `classifier_rules.yaml` were identified as
  required assets during the diagnose phase but never actually copied. Both
  surfaced only when `from scanner import pipeline` and `Config.load(...)`
  were run per VERIFY step 3. Fixed inline; recorded in DRIFT.md with a note
  that they were caught late, not designed in from the start.
- **VERIFY step 3's literal command doesn't match the real API**: `scanner.config.Config`
  has no `.load()` classmethod; loading is a module-level function
  `scanner.config.load(path)`. Ran the corrected equivalent
  (`from scanner.config import load; load(...)`) instead, which passes.
- **pytest is not 75/75 green.** `tests/test_scanner_core.py`'s module-scoped
  `cfg` fixture calls `Config.load("scanner/config.yaml")` — the same
  non-existent classmethod VERIFY step 3 hit. 26 tests that don't use this
  fixture pass; the other 49 error at fixture setup. This is a pre-existing
  file (already committed before this prompt, per BUILD_STATE.md's earlier
  claim of "75 tests, all green") — its tests could not have actually
  exercised `scanner.config` before this prompt, since `scanner/` did not
  exist in this project until now. Not fixed here: whether to change the test
  fixture, or give `scanner/config.py` a compatibility `Config.load()`
  classmethod (which would be a local edit requiring DRIFT.md treatment,
  since it touches vendored donor code), is a decision, not a mechanical
  vendoring step.

Open for next session:
- File the `migrate()` missing-`MIGRATIONS_DIR` donor bug against
  referral-system's `lib_snapshot/db.py` (currently only fixed locally, per
  DRIFT.md).
- Fill `LLM_API_KEY`, `LLM_BASE_URL`, `DEFAULT_MODEL`, `PREMIUM_MODEL`,
  `RESEARCH_WORKERS`, `JSEARCH_API_KEY`, `PREDICTLEADS_API_TOKEN`,
  `THEIRSTACK_API_KEY` in the real `.env` by hand (added to `.env.example`
  only, per instruction not to touch `.env`).
- Prompt 5's `preflight()` must assert that `classifier_rules.yaml` (project
  root) actually resolves and opens. `scanner/classifier.py`'s `load_rules()`
  opens `cfg.classifier_rules_file` as a bare relative filename against the
  process's CWD, not against `__file__` or `scanner/config.yaml`'s own
  location — this only works because the placement happens to match the CWD
  workflow-d's own entrypoints run from. A run launched from any other
  working directory silently loses the classifier (every job falls through to
  the deterministic no-match path) rather than failing loudly. Do not change
  the placement now; just gate on it in preflight.

## Prompt 0 follow-up fixes - 2026-07-28

Fixed two bugs in workflow-d's own code (not vendored code — `scanner/config.py`
was never touched, no classmethod added to it):

1. `src/signal_pipeline.py`'s `scan()` and `tests/test_scanner_core.py`'s `cfg`
   fixture both called a nonexistent `Config.load(...)` classmethod. Changed
   both to the real API, `scanner.config.load(path)` (a module-level
   function), imported as `from scanner import config as scanner_config` in
   both places to avoid colliding with `signal_pipeline.py`'s existing
   `from . import wd_config as config`.
2. Ran `pytest tests/ -q` again: **75 passed, 0 errors, 0 failures** — this
   time for real, against the live `scanner/config.py` and the actual 9KB
   `config.yaml`, not a stub `Config` in a scratch harness. No assertion
   failures surfaced: the title-pattern, geo, and grouping tests all hold
   against the real config. Nothing was touched to make this pass; it is the
   first genuine run of this suite against the real scanner code.
3. `scripts/office/soffice.py` was missing (referenced by `lib_referral/config.py`'s
   `SOFFICE_SCRIPT`, used by `deck_filler.py` for PPTX→PDF). Copied with a
   provenance header, added to DRIFT.md. Verified:
   `lib_referral.config.SOFFICE_SCRIPT` resolves to
   `C:\Users\DELL\Job-ScannerOutreach\scripts\office\soffice.py`, and
   `.exists()` is `True`.
4. `git check-ignore -v .env` → `.gitignore:1:.env	.env` (exit 0), confirmed
   identically with `--no-index`. `.gitignore`'s first line does carry a
   leading UTF-8 BOM (hex dump: `ef bb bf 2e 65 6e 76...` = BOM + `.env`), but
   git 2.54.0 strips a leading BOM when parsing `.gitignore`, so the rule
   matches as plain `.env` and `.env` is genuinely ignored. Not rewritten —
   the instruction was conditional on the BOM actually breaking the match,
   and the evidence shows it does not.
5. Committed — see the commit this entry is part of for the exact message,
   `git log --stat -1`, and post-commit `git status --short`.
